Our beat reporter caught word of a cat struck in a tree at Cherry and 3rd.
Resident deli owner Henry Berringer says he chased the cat out of his store
at 3:00 PM. Regular customer Susan Crandon says the cat was chasing rats.
Henry Berringer denies this allegation.

Netizens have been raving over local cat show "Paws at the Pumpkin Patch". The next
cat show "My Furry Valentine" would be held at the city square center on February.

Expect rainy weathers over the next couple of days.
